  ## Description

  Create a CronJob that performs ETCD Backup and stores the backup to a PV.

This Helm Chart can be used to create a backup of ETCD.
It will execute a CronJob on one of the control planes in order to dump ETCD and store it to a PV.

**WARNING**: In order to be able to create such a backup, this CronJob must be able to start a *PRIVILEGED* pod.

**CAUTION**: The backup contains two files: the etcd DB and a tar.gz. If etcd is encrypted, then the tar.gz will contain the keys to decrypt the DB. It is up to the storage team to be sure that the access to the share is secure.
(Maybe in the future I can extend the Chart ... or just create a pull request :) )

The following objects/settings will be created:

1. Namespace: where will the cronjob be scheduled. (Default etcd-backup)
2. ClusterRole: a dedicated Role that allows to get/list nodes and start a Debug pod.
3. ServiceAccount: The ServiceAccount the CronJob will use (Default etcd-backup).
4. ClusterRoleBinding: A binding that binds the ServiceAccount to the ClusterRole.
5. ClusterRoleBinding-Privileged: A binding that binds the ServiceAccount to the SCC system:openshift:scc:privileged.
6. PersistentVolumeClaim: The Claim to the Storage where the backup will be stored.
7. Optional: PersistentVolume: A dedicated PV, used by the PVC. This is optional and might be automatically created, depending on the StorageClass.
8. CronJob: The actual CronJob starts a Debug Pod to execute the backup script.

## CronJob Workflow

The CronJob will perform the following:

1. It will start a debug pod **on one of the Control Planes** (The CronJob is scheduled on one of the Control Planes).
2. Via the Debug pod, on the Control Plane it will execute the script **/usr/local/bin/cluster-backup.sh** and store it into **/home/core/backup** (on the Control Plane).
3. Then a target folder might be created, if it does not exist yet using configured mountpath and the name of the cluster.
4. The backup files are moved from /host/home/core/backup/* (This is the backup location from the CronJob point of view) to the target folder.
5. To save some space, the files will be zipped.
6. Finally, backup files that are older than the **retention** time (default 30 days) will be removed from the target folder and from the Control Plane.

## Verify the backup

The fole **POD_ManualBackupCheck.yaml** contains an example pod, that could be used to verify the backup.
Per default, the backup is stored in the mounted PVC at **etcd-backup**. When you open a terminal to that Pod you can verify the backups:

```bash
sh-4.4# ls -la /etcd-backup/ocp/
total 73080
drwxrwxrwx. 2 root root     4096 Mar 17 05:50 .
drwxr-xr-x. 4 root root     4096 Mar 17 05:42 ..
-rw-------. 1 root root 24996317 Mar 17 05:48 snapshot_2024-03-17_054810.db.gz
-rw-------. 1 root root 24922192 Mar 17 05:49 snapshot_2024-03-17_054903.db.gz
-rw-------. 1 root root 24657038 Mar 17 05:50 snapshot_2024-03-17_055004.db.gz
-rw-------. 1 root root    78022 Mar 17 05:48 static_kuberesources_2024-03-17_054810.tar.gz
-rw-------. 1 root root    78022 Mar 17 05:49 static_kuberesources_2024-03-17_054903.tar.gz
-rw-------. 1 root root    78022 Mar 17 05:50 static_kuberesources_2024-03-17_055004.tar.gz
```

**CAUTION**: The backup contains two files: the etcd DB and a tar.gz. If etcd is encrypted, then the tar.gz will contain the keys to decrypt the DB. It is up to the storage team to be sure that the access to the share is secure.
