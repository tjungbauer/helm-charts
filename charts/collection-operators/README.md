  ## Description

  Collection of Operators which can be deployed on Demo Systems without any configuration of a CRD.

This chart can be used to install Operators in OpenShift WITHOUT any additional configuration. Such charts were initially grouped into the purpose of the Operator ... here Operators like ServiceMesh or Logging are deployed.
However, you can install any Operator with this chart. Also, I usually do not use this option of installation operators anymore, since here the chart helper-status-checker is not used.

This chart will create the objects: Namespace, Subscription, OperatorGroup and a Job, that will enable additional console plugins, if enabled.

It is best used with a GitOps approach such as Argo CD does. For example: https://github.com/tjungbauer/openshift-clusterconfig-gitops

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install my-release tjungbauer/<chart-name>>
```

The command deploys the chart on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration.

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the my-release deployment:

```console
helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
