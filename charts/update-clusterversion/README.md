  ## Description

  A Helm chart to update OpenShift ClusterVersion

This Chart can be used to start a cluster update using a GitOps approach.
All you need are the required channel, the version and (optionally) the image-sha.

All this information can be found by `oc get clusterversion/version -o yaml`.

Simply select the channel, version etc and update your values file.
Once Argo CD syncs the changes the update process will start.

This chart has the following dependencies:

| Repository | Name | Version |
