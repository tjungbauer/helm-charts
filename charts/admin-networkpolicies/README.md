|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| anp | list | '' | AdminNetworkPolicy |
| anp[0] | object | N/A | Name of the AdminNetworkPolicy. Only Applicable for ANP. |
| anp[0].enabled | bool | false | Enable this ANP or not. You must explicitly set this to "true" |
| anp[0].priority | int | 50 | Priority is a value from 0 to 1000 (0-99 according to OpenShift documentation). Policies with lower priority values have higher precedence, and are checked before policies with higher priority values. Any ANP should have a unique priority |
