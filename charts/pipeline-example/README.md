  ## Description

  Create an example Pipeline which does a linting of openshift-clusterconfig-gitops using kubelinter, yamllin, yamlscore ....

# DEMO Pipeline using OpenShift Pipelines/Tekton

This straightforward Chat is simply used to demonstrate OpenShift Pipelines. The task is to perform a Helm linting on my Helm repository. It can be used as basis for more sophisticated Charts.

It is best used with a GitOps approach such as Argo CD does. For example, https://github.com/tjungbauer/openshift-clusterconfig-gitops

It only comes with one parameter `demo_pipelines` and requires the configuration of a Webhook in GitHub to trigger the Pipeline accordingly.

```

The command deploys the chart on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration.
